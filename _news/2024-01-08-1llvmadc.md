We successfully organized the LLVM-AD workshop at the Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2024.
The event brought together leading researchers and industry experts to explore the latest applications of large language
models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) in the autonomous driving (AD) domain.

The workshop featured insightful talks from distinguished speakers, including Dr. Oleg Sinavski from Wayve, Dr. Zhen Li
from CUHKSZ, and Dr. Yu Huang from Roboraction.ai. Their expertise greatly contributed to the success of the event,
sparking engaging discussions. We look forward to organizing more workshops in the future to advance the field of
multi-modal LLMs for autonomous driving.
