  about_me: <p>I am currently a Research Intern at the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bosch-center-for-artificial-intelligence-bcai/posts/?feedView=all" target="_blank">Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence</a>, where I focus on advancing <strong>Foundation Models for Autonomous Planning</strong>. Alongside this, I am a second-year PhD student at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">Purdue University</a> in the <a href="https://purduedigitaltwin.github.io/" target="_blank">Digital Twin Lab</a>, advised by <a href="https://ziranw.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Ziran Wang</a>. In 2022, I earned my Master's degree in <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> from <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New York University</a>.</p> <p>My research interests center on building foundation models for generalizable autonomy. I am deeply passionate about advancing my expertise in autonomous driving, foundation models, multimodal learning, and embodied AI.</p>
