  about_me: <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/logo/purdue_icon.png" alt="Purdue Logo" style="height:20px;vertical-align:middle;"> Purdue University</a>, working in the <a href="https://purduedigitaltwin.github.io/" target="_blank">Digital Twin Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://ziranw.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Ziran Wang</a>. I hold a Master’s degree in <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> from <img src="assets/img/logo/NYU_Short_RGB_Color.png" alt="NYU Logo" style="height:20px;vertical-align:middle;"> <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New York University</a>. Currently, I am a research intern at <img src="/assets/img/logo/waymo_logo.png" alt="Waymo Logo" style="height:20px;vertical-align:middle;"><a href="https://waymo.com/research/" target="_blank">Waymo Research</a>. I have previously completed research internships at <img src="/assets/img/logo/bosch_logo.png" alt="Bosch Logo" style="height:25px;vertical-align:middle;"> Bosch Research North America and <img src="assets/img/logo/Toyota-Logo-1978.png" alt="Toyota Logo" style="height:25px;vertical-align:middle;">Toyota North America. My research focuses on enhancing the generalization and reasoning capabilities of end-to-end models, particularly in handling long-tail scenarios.</p>

I am inspired by Steve Jobs' words: *"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it."*
