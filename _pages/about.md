  about_me: <p>I am currently a research intern at the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bosch-center-for-artificial-intelligence-bcai/posts/?feedView=all" target="_blank">Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence</a>, where I work on <strong>Foundation Models for Autonomous Planning</strong>. I am also a second-year PhD student at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">Purdue University</a>'s <a href="https://purduedigitaltwin.github.io/" target="_blank">Digital Twin Lab</a>, advised by <a href="https://ziranw.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Ziran Wang</a>. Previously, I received my Master's degree in <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> from <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New York University</a> in 2022. My research is at the intersection of multimodal learning and autonomous systems.</p>
