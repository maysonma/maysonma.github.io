  about_me: <p>I am currently a Research Intern at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bosch-center-for-artificial-intelligence-bcai/posts/?feedView=all" target="_blank">Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence</a>, focusing on Foundation Models for Autonomous Planning. I am also a second-year PhD student at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">Purdue University</a>'s <a href="https://purduedigitaltwin.github.io/" target="_blank">Digital Twin Lab</a>, advised by <a href="https://ziranw.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Ziran Wang</a>. I earned my Master's degree in <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> from <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New York University</a> in 2022. My research interests revolve around foundation models for generalizable autonomy, with a special focus on autonomous driving, vision-language models, multimodal learning, and embodied AI.</p>

I am inspired by Steve Jobs' words: *"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it."*
