  about_me: <p>I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">Purdue University</a>, working in the <a href="https://purduedigitaltwin.github.io/" target="_blank">Digital Twin Lab</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://ziranw.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Ziran Wang</a>. Concurrently, I am a research intern at the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bosch-center-for-artificial-intelligence-bcai/posts/?feedView=all" target="_blank">Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence</a>, where I focus on advancing foundation models for autonomous driving. I hold a Master's degree in <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> from <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New York University</a>. My research interests include foundation models for autonomous driving, with an emphasis on vision-language models, multimodal learning, and embodied AI.</p>

I am inspired by Steve Jobs' words: *"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it."*
